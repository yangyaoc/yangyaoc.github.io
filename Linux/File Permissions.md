# File permissions in Linux
## Project description
At my organization, the research team needs to update the file permissions for specific files and directories within the `projects` directory. Currently, the permissions do not  show the level of authorization that should be permitted. Checking and updating these permissions will help maintain their system secure. To achieve this task, I demonstrated the following tasks:
## Check file and directory details
The code below shows how I wrote Linux commands to exam the existing permissions set for a specific directory in the file system.

The first line of the screenshot shows the command I input, and the rest displays the output. The code displays all contents of the projects directory. By using `ls` command with the `-la` option, it shows a detailed listing of the file contents that also returned hidden files. The output of my command exhibits that there is one directory named `drafts`, one hidden file named `.project_x.txt`, and five other project files. The 10-character in the first column displays the permissions set on each file or directory.

## Describe the permissions string
The 10-character string can be deconstructed to determine who is authorized to access the file and their specific permissions. The characters and what they represent are as follows:
| Character                   | Description                                 |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| 1st character |It is either a `d` or hyphen (`-`) and indicates the file type.  `d` is a directory. (`-`) is a regular file.|
