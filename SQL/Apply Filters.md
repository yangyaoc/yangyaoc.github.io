# Apply filters to SQL queries

## Project description
My organization is working to make their system more secure. It is my job to ensure the system
is safe, investigate all potential security issues, and update employee computers as needed.
The following steps provide examples of how I used SQL with filters to perform
security-related tasks.

## Retrieve after hours failed login attempts
There was a potential security incident that occurred after business hours (after 18:00). All after
hours login attempts that failed need to be investigated.
The following code demonstrates how I created a SQL query to filter for failed login attempts
that occurred after business hours.
